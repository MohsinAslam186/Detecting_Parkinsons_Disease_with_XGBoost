# Detecting_Parkinsons_Disease_with_XGBoost
Detect the presence of Parkinson’s Disease in individuals using various factors. We used an XGBClassifier for this and made use of the sklearn library to prepare the dataset. 
This gives us an accuracy of 94.87%, which is great considering the number of lines of code in this python project.

What is Parkinson’s Disease?

Parkinson’s disease is a progressive disorder of the central nervous system affecting movement and inducing tremors and stiffness.
It has 5 stages to it and affects more than 1 million individuals every year in India. This is chronic and has no cure yet. It is a neurodegenerative disorder
affecting dopamine-producing neurons in the brain.

What is XGBoost?

XGBoost is a new Machine Learning algorithm designed with speed and performance in mind. XGBoost stands for eXtreme Gradient Boosting and is based on decision trees. 
In this project, we will import the XGBClassifier from the xgboost library; this is an implementation of the scikit-learn API for XGBoost classification.

Detecting Parkinson’s Disease with XGBoost – Objective:
To build a model to accurately detect the presence of Parkinson’s disease in an individual.

Detecting Parkinson’s Disease with XGBoost :
In this Python machine learning project, using the Python libraries scikit-learn, numpy, pandas, and xgboost, we will build a model using an XGBClassifier. 
We’ll load the data, get the features and labels, scale the features, then split the dataset, build an XGBClassifier, and then calculate the accuracy of our model.

Dataset for Python Machine Learning Project:
You’ll need the UCI ML Parkinsons dataset for this; you can download it here("https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/parkinsons/"). 
The dataset has 24 columns and 195 records and is only 39.7 KB.

Prerequisites:

You’ll need to install the following libraries with pip:

pip install numpy pandas sklearn xgboost
